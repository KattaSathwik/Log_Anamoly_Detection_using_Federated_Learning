# Log_Anamoly_Detection_using_Federated_Learning
The project aims to develop a DL based model for anomaly detection in log sequences. It employs BERT for representation learning and utilizes a federated approach. The CNN model is used for classification.

Description:
The project focuses on identifying unusual patterns or anomalies in log data, which can indicate errors, security breaches, or system malfunctions. The core of the project is a machine learning model that learns from log sequences using BERT for feature extraction and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for anomaly classification. Federated Learning is employed to train the model across multiple devices or servers without sharing the raw data, thus maintaining data confidentiality and compliance with data privacy regulations.

Requirements:
Data Sources:

HDFS and BGL Logs: Historical log data from systems like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and BlueGene/L (BGL).
Machine Learning Models:

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): For representation learning, capturing the contextual relationships in log data.
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): For classifying the extracted features into normal or anomalous logs.
Federated Learning Framework:

Flower: A flexible framework for federated learning that allows seamless deployment and coordination of federated tasks.
Federated Setup: Devices or servers participate in training by locally computing updates, which are then aggregated to update the global model without sharing raw data.
Programming Languages and Libraries:

Python: Primary language for implementing the machine learning models and federated learning framework.
TensorFlow or PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks for model development.
NLTK or SpaCy: For any additional natural language processing tasks.
NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Infrastructure and Tools:

Central Server: For coordinating the federated learning process and aggregating model updates.
Local Devices or Servers: For decentralized data processing and local model training.
Git and GitHub: For version control and collaborative development.
Privacy and Security Measures:

Secure Aggregation Protocols: To ensure the privacy of model updates.
Data Encryption: To protect data during communication and storage.
Testing and Evaluation:

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluating the model's performance.
Benchmarking: Testing against known anomalous logs to ensure detection capabilities.
This project aims to create a robust and privacy-preserving solution for log anomaly detection, leveraging the strengths of deep learning and federated learning.
